# Computer Vision Project
## Current Work In Progress

## Project Details
Project details can be found in the project_overview.md 

## Dataset
DeepFashion-Multimodal Dataset https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal 

## Instructions
1. Download the dataset from the DeepFashion-Multimodal Dataset source

## TO DO:
- Refine Task 2:
    Currently
    1. has to have original image AND segmentation map in Uploads folder;
    
    In future:
    1. take in only original image (generate segmentation map with pretrained model fine-tuned on DeepFashion dataset)
    
- Refine Task 3:
  
    Currently
    1. has to have original image AND segmentation map in Uploads folder;
    2. takes in HSV inputs;
    
    In future:
    1. take in only original image (generate segmentation map with pretrained model fine-tuned on DeepFashion dataset)
    2. take user input of semantic colours instead of HSV values

## Completed Tasks:
- Task 1: Changing Colour of Shirt in an image while preserving shadows/brightness
- Task 2: superimpose shirt onto desired background
